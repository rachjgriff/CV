## Rachel Griffiths

An unexpected end to my 14 year Merchandising career in Retail, has led me to the world of coding and software development.  What I currently lack in tech skills (so far I have a few codeacademy courses, a 6 kyu on codewars and the Makers pre-course under my belt) I make up for with a beligerant need for logic and solutions.  In my previous roles, I loved building reports, discovering new excel formulas, automising processes, improving efficiency and analysing the data I manipulated. These are all things that are relatable to learning and building code.  I also have a wealth of experience in presenting, relationship building with external partners and managing teams which at one point reached 13 members.

I am excited about the prospect of joining the tech industry, due to the constant need to learn and adapt, and the variety of paths you can take in your career. It’s especially exciting with all the current focus that Women in the tech industry are receiving – to be part of that revolution would be amazing!
