<br>

I am a software developer who started coding with [Codeacademy for Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby) for the first time in February 2019, and recently graduated (August 2019) from the 12 week coding bootcamp at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech). During this time, I have developed a process to learn new technologies and build software using TDD and Agile methodologies in a time efficient way.

After a 14 year Merchandising career in Retail, a need for a career (and brain!!) restart, as well as my beligerant need for logic and my solutions orientated approach, led me to the world of tech.  In my previous roles, I loved building reports and programs using excel, automising processes, improving team efficiency and analysing data to drive change and get results. I also developed a wealth of experience in cross functional teamwork, risk management, stakeholder management and leadership.  With these additional skills, I believe I can successfully transition into the tech industry as a Software Developer.

I am excited about the prospect of joining the tech industry due to the constant need to learn and adapt, and the variety of paths you can take in your career. It’s especially exciting with all the current focus that Women in the tech industry are receiving – to be part of this revolution would be amazing!

## PROJECTS

Although, none of the below projects are complete or particularly original, they all demonstrate how much i've learnt on my 3 month coding journey.

| Project | Description | Time Frame | Technologies |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- 
| [Acebook](https://github.com/lucianmot/acebook-off-the-rails) | Team project to build a clone of Facebook.  We followed agile processes & created a [vlog](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjQnMV5qEJ1BF_MSobdw01Q) to document our learnings. | 10 days | Capybara, Heroku, PostgreSQL, Rails, RSpec, Rubocop, Travis CI|
| [Guilt Tripper](https://github.com/rhysco8/greenpeas-uk) | Team project to build an eco-friendly app in the final 2 weeks of Makers.  We applied the process we learnt during the course to use a tech stack that we hadn't used before whilst maintaining Agile methods. The app checks products for palm oil and returns current news articles on this if the product contains it | 8 days | Swift, Xcode |
| [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/rachjgriff/bowling-challenge) | Individual project to replocate a bowling scorecard after learning javascript in 5 days. Although I did not complete the user interface part of the challenge, I was particulary proud of completing the logic of the scorecard in a new language. | 2 days | Javascript, Jasmine |
| [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/rachjgriff/bank) | Individual project to print bank transactions in a specific bank statement format.  Although not perfect and further refactoring is required, this demonstrates my understanding of OOP and mocking. | 4 days | Ruby, RSpec, Rubocop, SimpleCov, Travis CI |
| [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/rachjgriff/rps-challenge) | Individual project to create my first solo web app that tested my understanding of the MVC structure | 2 days | Capybara, RSpec, Rubocop, Ruby, SimpleCov, Sinatra |
